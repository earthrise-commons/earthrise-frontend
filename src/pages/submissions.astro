      <h2>About Earthrise Commons</h2>
      <p>
        Earthrise Commons will serve as a digital resource companion to our Open
        Access book, featuring projects that highlight how sustainability
        education and community engagement are being integrated into courses,
        programs, and community initiatives worldwide. These submissions will
        celebrate diverse approaches to sustainability education and offer
        actionable insights and models that can be adapted by other institutions
        and communities to enhance learner engagement, equity, and impact.
      </p><p>
        Selected submissions are a form of publishing that you can use to build
        community, advance ideas, and sprinkle some sustainability learning and
        community engagement into your teaching, no matter your field of study.
