## Why This Work Matters

Knowledge is sunlight, which flows energy into green leaves, blossoms, and fruit. When one person learns about clean energy, better farming, or alleviating poverty, it doesn't take away knowledge from someone else but rather pollinates and grows our wisdom. When more people understand and act on these ideas, our future gets brighter.

Too often, schools keep knowledge walled into separate subjects. We’re overcoming these walls. We envision a place where a scientist’s ideas can imprint an artist’s imaginative lesson plan. Different types of learning can connect and grow together. Just because fields of study are different doesn’t mean they can’t relate to each other.
