We want Earthrise Commons to be a ‘third place.’ An idea coined by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, a third place is an environment that’s not home (our first place) or work (our second place). Instead, it’s where people meet and build community. Think of coffee shops, parks, libraries, and community centers.

These places help communities grow. They welcome everyone. Your background doesn’t matter. You can come and go freely. You can talk with friends and meet new people.

The best third places are free, like piazzas, parks, and libraries. They help people feel connected to their community. Third places matter for our well-being. They help people feel less alone. They help communities stay healthy. More people work from home now and spend time online. We need more real and digital meeting places. We hope Earthrise Commons can bring sustainability learning into your home and classroom.
