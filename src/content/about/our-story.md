## Our Story

In 1968, an astronaut on the Apollo 8 Mission, Bill Anders, took a famous photo. For the first time, we saw Earth rising over the moon and floating in space. Our planet looked like a bright blue marble swirling with white clouds. This photo changed how people think about Earth. We could see that weâ€™re all one community sharing the same planet. Designer Buckminster Fuller called our shared journey on this blue marble Spaceship Earth.

Earthrise Commons comes from this idea. We work best when we come together around what we share. We live in Earth as part of nature, not on Earth, separate from it.

We think sustainability means living well with ourselves, each other, and nature. We see this in that perspective-changing photo of our planet. Our project is a prototype, a response to this call for education and action, to create harmony and peace within ourselves, others, and the more-than-human world.
