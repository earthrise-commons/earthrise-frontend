## Our Team

This project grew from caring people in diverse disciplines working together. Again, we are grateful for grant money from SUNY OER IITG Impact Grants and Primary Source (a Massachusetts nonprofit) that helped make it possible. We also work with a student intern who learns about Open Scholarship and Sustainability with us. These two ideas connect in the idea of a commons, where people are stewards of shared environments.
