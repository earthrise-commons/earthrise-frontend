## What We're Building

Earthrise Commons comprises two main projects that work together. Think of this as a community space, not just a place to store files. A community garden, not a warehouse of resources. Everything is free to use, remix, and share.

First, we made a free book called Sustainability Learning for Action and Community Engagement (published by Palgrave Macmillan Springer Nature in 2025). This book is about how people do sustainability education, and also how to be a sustainability educator. It shares ideas from teachers and community practitioners around the world. Most of our book authors work at colleges.

Second, we built this website as a platform with teaching materials. It has lesson plans, videos, and activities that teachers can use and change. We want these ideas to reach schools from kindergarten to college. Sustainability should be part of education at every level.
