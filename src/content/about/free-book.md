Our Open Access book, Sustainability Learning for Action and Community Engagement (Palgrave Macmillan Springer Nature, to be published in 2025), brings together 50 people who teach sustainability in better and different, hands-on, and enlivening ways. Most work at SUNY schools. We also include voices from South Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland. Good ideas come when different people share their thoughts across cultures and disciplines.

Books like this usually cost around $128. Companies put them behind paywalls. We think good ideas should be free and easy to share. Weâ€™re deeply grateful for generous support from grant money from two SUNY IITG OER Impact Grants and Primary Source, a Massachussetts educational non-profit. These grants helped us make the book free on SpringerLink. This website gets 285 million visitors each year. You can read online, print pages or chapters, or listen to music and watch videos here.
