## Our Impact

In our first years, based on our networks, we think we can help 1,000 to 2,000 students each year. This number could grow much more as teachers adapt and share what they find here.

That famous Earthrise photo reminded us that weâ€™re all traveling together on this small blue planet. Earthrise Commons invites us to learn together as passengers and caretakers of Earth on a shared journey around the sun.
