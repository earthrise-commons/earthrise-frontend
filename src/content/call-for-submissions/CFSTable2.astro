          Through what authentic performance tasks will students demonstrate
          understanding?

            Examples of authentic tasks (projects, presentations, portfolios,

          What other evidence will show student achievement? Include
          pre-assessment, formative, and summative assessments — both formal and
          informal.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-assessment: diagnostic checks, prior-knowledge probes</li>
          <li>
            Formative: quizzes, exit tickets, observations, drafts, peer
            feedback

          <li>Summative: tests, final projects, performances</li>
          <li>
            Informal evidence: class discussion notes, teacher anecdotal
            records, student journals
