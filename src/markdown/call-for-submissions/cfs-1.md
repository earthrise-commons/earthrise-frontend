## Why Contribute?

### By sharing your work, you will:

- Join a local and global community of sustainability educators and practitioners
- Contribute to open educational resources for sustainability action
- Connect with peers through our collaborative webinar series
- Help build a more sustainable and equitable future

We’re transforming a forthcoming anthology, Sustainability Learning for Action & Community Engagement (Palgrave Macmillan SpringerNature), into a living sustainability education platform called the Earthrise Commons. This Open Education Resource will provide educators worldwide (high school through college undergraduate) with free, accessible, adaptable, and shareable content to support sustainability education and action.

### The platform will include:

- A Creative Commons License:
  - CC-BY-NC
  - CC-BY-SA
  - CC-BY
- Original book chapters via SpringerLink (with metrics)
- Lesson plans that educators can modify
- Interactive resources and videos
- A toolbox of sustainability competencies and frameworks
- Student work examples (with permission)

The project uses an open-source infrastructure, managed by a team of curators at SUNY New Paltz, U.S. The design prioritizes search ability, follows UN Global Goals taxonomies, and supports Universal Design for Learning principles. This approach activates sustainability education in a collaborative, interdisciplinary learning space where knowledge can be shared and built upon by the community.

### Each submission may also include:

- A personal bio page (optional, this can be as short as two lines)

On your bio page, you may provide:

- Links to more resources
- An indication that you’re open to being contacted about the project
- An email contact method
